            <p>Lines Police CAD may disclose your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is
                necessary to:</p>

            To comply with a legal obligation

            <br>


            <h2>Security Of Data</h2>
            <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the
                Internet,
                or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to

            <h2>Service Providers</h2>
            <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), to

                not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

            <h3>Analytics</h3>
            <p>We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>Google Analytics</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic.

                uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other
                Google
                services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own
                advertising
                network.
            </p>
            <p>You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing
                the Google
                Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js,
                analytics.js,
                and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.</p>
